## Short Bio

Now I am an algorithm engineer in Baidu. In Jun. 2021, I received my master's dergee in the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Longjun Liu](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liulongjun), before that, I got my bachelor's degree in the [Honors College](https://honors.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), in Jun. 2018. I will start my Ph.D program in the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), in Sept. 2022, advised by Prof. [Di Hu](https://dtaoo.github.io/).
