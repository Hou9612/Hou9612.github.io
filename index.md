## About me

Now I am a third-year Ph.D student in the [GeWu-Lab](https://gewu-lab.github.io/),   [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Di Hu](https://dtaoo.github.io/). Now my main research focuses on multimodal learning towards real-world scene understanding, aiming to guide the machine to perceive and understand natural scenes like human beings.

I have received my master's dergee in the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Longjun Liu](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liulongjun), in June 2021. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in the [Honors College](https://honors.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), in June 2018. I also have several industrial work experiences, in  [iFlytek](https://www.iflytek.com/index.html), [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/), [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), and [Hithink](https://www.10jqka.com.cn/), respectively.
